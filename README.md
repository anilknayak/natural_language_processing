# Natual Language Processing
Through this we will learn NLP (natual language processing) and design a Voice Assistant application using deep learning techniques. Following are the steps, we will cover and create a voice assistant application to search anything like Alexa, Google home does it for you. This tutorial will also cover Youtube, spotify, Youtube music and Google search integrations.

1. Trigger word detection: Which will wake up our assistant using a wake word to listen to our voice request.
2. Listen user request: Which will listen user voice request for certain time period.
3. Convert voice to text: Which will convert user voice to text.
4. Search internet cloud: Which will search the text using any www search engine.
5. Post processor: Finalize the search results.
6. Convert text to voice: Convert the search result to voice.

# Tutorial:
## 1: Trigger Word Detection
1. Goto trigger word detection ipython notebook for more.

### Dataset setup:
1. create a directory 'data'
2. inside that create 3 directories 'positives', 'negatives' and 'backgrounds'
3. backgrounds dir: should have some audio clip of 10 sec
4. negatives dir: should have some audio clip of 1-2 sec duration for negative words
5. positives dir: should have some audio clips of 1 sec duration for trigger words.
